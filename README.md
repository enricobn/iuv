# IUV #
Kotlin js UI framework inspired to elm 
(http://elm-lang.org)

### Compile, test and run the examples
From the command line : `./gradlew build` 

The first time it will be slow since it will download node js, yarn and all javascript libraries.

That task creates a web folder under iuv-examples/build, then you have to open index.html with a browser.  

### Install
Since it's not in a remote repository, for now, you have to install locally. From the command line :  
`./gradlew install`

This task will install locally iuv-core iuv-share and iuv-jvm (empty for now).
