### Install iuv-core
Since it's not in a remote repository, for now, you have to install locally:  
`./gradlew iuv:iuv-core install`

### Compile and run the examples pages
- when you change (and install) a new version on the iuv-core library you have to delete the examples/buttons/out folder.
- from IntelliJ build the project (Ctrl-F9)
- right click on examples/buttons/web/examples_buttons.html -> open in browser
- right click on examples/buttons/web/examples_grid.html -> open in browser

### Compile and run the unit tests
- when you change (and install) a new version on the iuv-core library you have to delete the examples/buttons/out folder.
