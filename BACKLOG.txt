- Intellij does not compile, there are not errors, it simply don't compile!!!
- rename IUVRoute typealias (ParamToView?) and rename RouteMatcher to IUVRoute
- HTML children (InputH for example) inherits all the functions of HTML (body for example) : there must be a coherent tree
- iuv-examples/node_modules are used only for tests. Can I create a node_modules_test and node_modules so I can use them in index.html?
- can I get rid of message wrappers for a child component?
