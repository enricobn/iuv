- examples/buttons/node_modules are used only for tests. Can I create a node_modules_test and node_modules so I can use them in index.html?
- can I get rid of message wrappers for a child UV?
- make the core build.gradle similar to examples, to create a build/web folder for tests
- fix IntelliJ problems (related to build system?):
  F3 to a core class from examples does not work, nor implement interface methods
- snabbdom files in examples/buttons/web/js must be replaced with the ones from version 0.7.0.
