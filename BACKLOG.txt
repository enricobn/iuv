Doing
-------
- cli for OpenApi
  - client : pass requestParam in url
  - anonymous enum
  - controller documentation
- cli for create new project
  - view
  - controller impl
  - client api
  - why I cannot add package to test and main?
  - add test or make Karma work if there are no tests

Next
-----
- command line tools:
    - can I use build instead of shadowJar?
    - is it correct to sort properties and parameters? For now I have added two parameters to the command line tool,
      by default they are false
- data class for exceptions for client
- ServletRouteMatcher could have a similar Interface of the IUVRouter RouteMatcher
- Intellij does not compile, there are not errors, it simply don't compile!!!
- rename IUVRoute typealias (ParamToView?) and rename RouteMatcher to IUVRoute
- HTML children (InputH for example) inherits all the functions of HTML (body for example) : there must be a coherent tree
- iuv-examples/node_modules are used only for tests. Can I create a node_modules_test and node_modules so I can use them in index.html?
- can I get rid of message wrappers for a child component?
