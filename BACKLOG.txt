Doing
-------
- I'm on branch view-returns-HTML
  - ExamplesIUV:
    - trying to make a kind of routing

Next
-----
- routing
- fix IntelliJ problems (related to build system?):
  F3 to a core class from examples does not work, nor implement interface methods
- trying to have a singleton MessageBus
- snabbdom files in examples/buttons/web/js must be replaced with the ones from version 0.7.0.
- debugger (look at IUVApplication)

Done
------
- on branch view-returns-HTML
  - Cmd.none
  - now view returns an HTML instead of HTML extension function
- on branch multiple-projects
  - I don't like that class GetAsync is open: make an interface or simply mock a Cmd?
  - created a PostService for ButtonComponent
  - tested init and simple update

- on branch commands
  - handle commands

- on branch multiple-projects
  - example project examples/buttons works

- on branch multiple-projects
 - initialize snabbdom in IUVApplication.init, to get rid of client code
