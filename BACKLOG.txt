Doing
-------
- organize examples:
  - in the main page only links to single examples
  - remove strange router examples and add a router example with link
  - add a button links example with a ButtonLink component
  - add a mouse move example with link
  - mario example: add a label to explain keys

Next
-----
- HTML children (InputH for example) inherits all the functions of HTML (body for example) : there must be a coherent tree
- iuv-examples/node_modules are used only for tests. Can I create a node_modules_test and node_modules so I can use them in index.html?
- can I get rid of message wrappers for a child component?
