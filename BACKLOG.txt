- IDEA plugin:
 - building (buildPlugin) seems not to put classes from dependencies (iuv-openapi-codegen project)
 - activate "Paste Html (IUV)" only if there's some HTML text to paste and it's a kotlin file
 - can I change "safely" the standard paste behavior?
 - doc in README
- doc in README for HTMLtoIUV command line
- rename project iuv-openapi-codegen to iuv-cli
- cli for OpenApi
  - use a .json or .yaml or to configure the api instead of command line args
  - client : pass requestParam in url
  - anonymous enum
  - controller documentation
  - handle multiple servers
  - option to create only client (per api)
  - model file is not "in package": I think is not a bad idea, otherwise I must make a directory with only one file,
    but the IDE complains
- cli for create new project
  - view
  - controller impl
  - client api
  - is settings.gradle.mustache for shared project needed?
- command line tools:
    - can I use build instead of shadowJar?
    - is it correct to sort properties and parameters? For now I have added two parameters to the command line tool,
      by default they are false
- data class for exceptions for client
- ServletRouteMatcher could have a similar Interface of the IUVRouter RouteMatcher
- rename IUVRoute type alias (ParamToView?) and rename RouteMatcher to IUVRoute
- HTML children (InputH for example) inherits all the functions of HTML (body for example) : there must be a coherent tree
- iuv-examples/node_modules are used only for tests. Can I create a node_modules_test and node_modules so I can use them in index.html?
- can I get rid of message wrappers for a child component?
